question
When testing the user registration page, you need to test the "Phone number" field. You have a lot of tests to do and you decide to generate random phone numbers - 11-digit numbers. The phone number must start with a "+" character, the first digit of the number must be 1.
Write a function called createPhoneNumber that returns a random phone number as a 12-length string starting with '+1' and random digits.
Indication.
Create a string containing the first two characters: '+1'.
Create a loop that runs 10 times.
In the body of the loop, get a random number between 0 and 9 and add that number to the string.
Example:
the createPhoneNumber () function returns the phone number as "+12345678910"


solution:

function createPhoneNumber(){
  let str = '+1';
  let num;
  while (num > 11){
    num++;
}
return str + Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + '';
}
