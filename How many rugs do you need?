question
You are given two positive integers a and b. a - corridor length, b - mat length. How many rugs (no overlap) are needed to cover 
the entire corridor?rugs
Write a function called countOfRugs that takes the numbers a and b as arguments and returns the maximum number of rugs of length b 
needed to make a hallway of length a.
Use the Math.floor () method

solution:

function countOfRugs(a, b){
if( a > b)
  return Math.floor(a / b);
  else if(a === b || a < b)
  return 0;
}
