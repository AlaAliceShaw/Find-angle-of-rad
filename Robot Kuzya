question
Let's teach the robot Kuzyu to speak. Let him round the exact values the way people do.
The exact value - a fractional number - is stored in the temperatureExact variable.
Get a line like "Outside the window is 32.3 degrees Celsius. That is almost 33"
Write a function called temperatureOutside that takes a positive integer temperatureExact (the exact temperature value)
as an argument and returns a string as above.



solution:

function temperatureOutside(temperatureExact) {
return `Outside the window is ${temperatureExact} degrees Celsius. That is almost ${Math.ceil(temperatureExact)}`;
}
