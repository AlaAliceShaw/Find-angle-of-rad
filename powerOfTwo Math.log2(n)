An indication of the solution. The Math.log2 (n) method returns the binary (base 2) logarithm of n.
Those. Math.log2 (n) is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to get the number n.
So if Math.log2 (n) is an integer, then n is a power of 2.
The solution to the problem is to check if Math.log2 (n) is an integer.
You can check that the number x is an integer using the condition x% 1 === 0 (this condition is true for integers and false for non-integers).


solution:

function isPowerOfTwo(n){
 if(Math.log2(n) % 1 === 0)
  return true;
  else 
  return false;
}
