question
The traveler covered the distance s1 km from point A to point B in t1 hours, then the distance s2 km from point B to point C in t2 hours. 
Find the average speed of the traveler and round the result to 2 decimal places.
Write a function averageSpeed that takes 4 numbers s1, t1, s2, t2 as arguments and returns the average speed of the traveler.
Round the result to 2 decimal places and return it as a number.


solution:

function averageSpeed(s1, t1, s2, t2){
  let midSpeed = (s1 + s2) / (t1 + t2);
  return +midSpeed.toFixed(2);
}
