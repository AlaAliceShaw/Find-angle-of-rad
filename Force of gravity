question
The force of gravity with which the Earth attracts a body on or near its surface is called gravity.
The force with which the Earth attracts bodies can be calculated by the formula F = mâ‹…g, where m is the mass
of the body and g is the acceleration of gravity. Near the Earth's surface, the value of g is approximately 9.81 m / s ** 2.
Write a function named forceOfGravity that takes m (body weight in kilograms) as an argument and returns gravity rounded to the nearest integer.



solution:


function forceOfGravity(m){
  let g = 9.81;
  return Math.round(m * g);
}
