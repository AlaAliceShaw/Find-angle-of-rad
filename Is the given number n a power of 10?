Write a function called isPowerOfTen that takes a non-negative number n as an argument and returns true if n is a power of 10, 
or false otherwise.
The number n is a power of 10 if there is an integer k such that 10 ** k = n.
An indication of the solution. The Math.log10 (n) method returns the decimal (base 10) logarithm of n. 
Those. Math.log10 (n) is the power to which 10 must be raised to get n.
Thus, if Math.log10 (n) is an integer, then n is a power of 10.

solution:

function isPowerOfTen(n){
  if(Math.log10(n) % 1 === 0)
  return true;
  else
  return false;
}
