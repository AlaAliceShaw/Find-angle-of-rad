question
There are four numbers - the areas of four squares. Find the side of the smallest square.
Write a minSquareSide function that takes four numbers a, b, c, d (the area of four squares) 
as arguments and returns the side of the least square.
Example:
minSquareSide (9, 4, 16, 81) should return 2 (minimum square area = 4, side = 2).

solution:

function minSquareSide(a, b, c, d){
  let sa = Math.sqrt(a);
  let sb = Math.sqrt(b);
  let sc = Math.sqrt(c);
  let sd = Math.sqrt(d);
  return Math.min(sa,sb,sc,sd);
}
