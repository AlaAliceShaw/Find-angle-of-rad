question
The values ​​of the coefficients of the quadratic equation a, b, c are given. Find the roots of the equation,
or return the message "No roots".
sqEquation
Recall that to find the roots of a quadratic equation, you need to find the discriminant by the formula:
d.
If D <0, the equation has no roots. Otherwise, the roots of the equation can be found by the formulas:
roots
Write a function called quadratic Equation that takes the values ​​of the numbers a, b, c as arguments and 
returns the roots of the equation as an array [x1, x2], or the message "No roots".

solution:

function quadraticEquation(a,b,c){
  let d = Math.pow(b, 2) - 4 * a * c;
  if(d < 0)
  return "There are no roots";
  }
    let x1 = (-b Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);
    let x2 = (-b Math.sqrt(d)) / (2 * a);
    return [x1, x2];
}
