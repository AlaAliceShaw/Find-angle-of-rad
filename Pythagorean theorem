question
The square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the legs (Pythagorean theorem).
Write a function called squareOfHypotenuse that takes two numbers a, b (leg length values) 
as arguments and returns the square of the hypotenuse

solution:

function squareOfHypotenuse(a, b){
  return Math.pow(a,2) + Math.pow(b,2);
}
