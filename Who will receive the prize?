question
The swim involved 3 athletes. The competition results are stored as an array:
[[name1, time1], [name2, time2], [name3, time3]].
Determine the winner's time.
Write a function named victoryInSwim that takes an arr array containing the results of the competition as an argument
and returns the fastest time. In all tests, 
the number of athletes is always 3.


solution:

function victoryInSwim(arr){
  let newArr = arr.map(el=> el[1]);
  return Math.min(...newArr);
}
