question
Write a function called isSquare that takes a number x as an argument and returns a string like
x is square of y if x is the square of some y,
message x is not a square if x is not a square of an integer.
Indication. You need to check if the square root of a number is an integer. For example, the root of 9 is 3 (integer),
the root of 7 is not an integer. You can check that the number x is an integer by checking if the condition x% 1 === 0 
(this condition is true for integers and false for non-integers).



solution:

function isSquare(x){
  let y = Math.sqrt(x);
  if (y % 1 === 0) return `${x} is square of ${y}`;
  else return `${x} is not a square`
  }
